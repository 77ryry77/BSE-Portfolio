# Gesture Controlled Car
The car is controlled by the way the person moves their arm.  If the person moves their arm forward or backwards it will make the car move.  If the person turns their arm it will make the car turn in the same direction.

# First Milestone
  

The first milestone was setting up and getting the car to move.  I had to test all the motors and switch the positive and negative wires in order to get them all the spin the right way.  Instead of using an ardunio uno board as the main controller, I used the esp because that is what I am going to need to do later on.  I had to use a motor control board which supplies the correct voltage to the motors.  It also allows you to easily control the direction of the motor.  A tricky part was getting the right voltage power for the esp.
