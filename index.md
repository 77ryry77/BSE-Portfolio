# Gesture Controlled Car
The car is controlled by the way the person moves their arm.  Any turns or movmenets forward and backwards are sensed by the accelerometer and this signals the car to move in a certain direction.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

The first milestone was setting up and getting the car to move.  I had to test all the motors and switch the positive and negative wires in order to get them all the spin the right way.  Instead of using an ardunio uno board as the main controller, I used the esp because that is what I am going to need to do later on.  I had to use a motor control board which supplies the correct voltage to the motors.  It also allows you to easily control the direction of the motor.  A tricky part was getting the right voltage power for the esp.
